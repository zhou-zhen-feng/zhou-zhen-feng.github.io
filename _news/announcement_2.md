Classroom Debate on the Management Model of "Public Institutions and Enterprise Management" in Media


***
In the media management class, our group debated with my classmates whether China should continue the "public institution, enterprise based operation" management model for media.

Our argument is that this management model should be continued, mainly in terms of politics, economy, culture, and a series of negative consequences brought  by adjusting the management model. The opposing argument is that the management model should not be continued, and this is discussed from the perspective of the negative impact of corporate management on the media.

After a fierce battle, our side won by a narrow margin.
